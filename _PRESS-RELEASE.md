There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.

WordFlow

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

A tool to help writers get writing.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

The first draft is always the hardest. WordFlow is a text editor with accountability. Instead of just telling you how many words you've written, it measures the consistency of your typing, and gives you a score based on your output. It encourages you to keep writing by sharing your consistency with other writers in real-time, and it helps you build good habits by analyzing and keeping track of your day-to-day writing output.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

Cheryl Strayed once said that the best advice for writers is, simply, "put butt in chair." Dylan Thomas would write down the first word of a poem, and then celebrate for the rest of the day. Breaking the silence is always the hardest part.

Facing down a blank screen can be daunting. It's too easy for a writer to over-think things, or get another cup of coffee, or go feed the cat — anything but actually write.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

By focusing on the consistency of the writing instead of the volume, WordFlow encourages writers to start typing, and discourages them from stopping until the time is up. And since users can see one another's output, there's an extra incentive to keep writing.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

"Using [Product Name] was the only way I was able to sit down and finish this press release."

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.

Just go to [deployed URL], say how long you want to write, and start typing. If you want to, you can create an account to see how other writers are doing and keep track of your day-to-day output.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

"I use this website every day." — Emily Dickinson

"I can't imagine writing without it." — William Faulkner

"10/10" — Abraham Lincoln

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
